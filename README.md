CS147 Project (Fall 2012)
================
This is the main repository for the CS147 project.

Getting things up and running
----------------
1. Clone the repo by running the following command in the directory you want to keep the project file in
	git clone https://github.com/rcchen/cs147-pharmville.git
2. Do your edits and things
	git add .
	git commit -m "Insert message here"
	git push
3. If you have conflicts when pushing, send out a message to the group so we can figure out what things should be merged. Auto-merge should be sufficient in most cases though.
